# Python-Pendulum
A school project pendulum simulation created by me.

How to run:

It is LIKELY that just going to the dist folder and runing the pendoulum.exe the programm will run normally without the need
of installing anything else.

If this doesn't work follow this steps:

Install all the dependencies:

•Install python3 and add it to path
•On terminal type: "cd (location of folder)". (e.g: cd C:\Python\projects\pendulum) 
•On terminal type: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Finaly run "pendulum.py" using python3:
On terminal type "python pendulum.py"

Or right click on pendulum.py and select "Open as" and select Python.


To exit, press the escape key. To restart the simulation with new values, press the R key.
